steps:
  - Pre-heat your oven to 200°C (390°F)
  - Wash the spinach, put it into a strainer and pour boiling water overtop of it
  - Press out as much water as you can out of the spinach as you can
  - Next, puree it, add the eggs, some salt and pepper and puree it again
  - Spread the paste on a baking tray covered with a baking paper and bake the wrap for about 10-15 minutes, until it gets firm
  - In the meantime, mix Crème fraîche, salt, pepper and dill in a bowl
  - Once the the wrap is getting firm, remove it from the oven and transfer it onto a mesh or a cutting bord. For removing it from the baking paper, you can use a spatula. If you placed the wrap onto a cutting board, you should flip it from time to time
  - Let the wrap cool fully. After about 5 minutes, dab the wrap with a paper towel from both sides, to get rid of the moisture building up on it
  - Once the wrap has cooled sufficiently, spread the cream on it, roll it and enjoy it
