  - Wash the spinach and chop it coarsely, before sautéing it for 2 minutes in a pan on medium heat
  - In the meantime, dice the onion
  - Once the spinach has shrunk, transfer it in to a bowl and add some olive oil, the onion and the inside of the zucchini to the pan. Season both with a litte bit of salt and garlic powder
  - Put the zucchinis onto a baking tray and pre-bake them in the oven for 10 minutes
  - Cut the feta into small cubes and add it to the spinach
  - Once the onions get transparent, you can also transfer them and the zucchini into the bowl
  - Now mix the cooked quinoa into the same bowl and season the stuffing with salt, pepper and some more garlic powder
  - Stuff the zucchinis and bake them for another 10 minutes
  - Enjoy!
