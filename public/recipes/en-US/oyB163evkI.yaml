steps:
  - Dice the onions and garlic cloves finely
  - Add a small amount of olive oil to a large pan (it has to fit the Pasta), heat it to medium heat and add the diced onions and garlic
  - Cut up your ham and add it to the pan. Lightly sautee everything for about 5 minutes
  - In the mean time, heat some water for the pasta and salt it once it boils
  - Now, add the tomatos and the cream to the pan and season the sauce with salt, pepper and oregano
  - Cook the pasta according to the instructions on the packaging, until they are "al dente" (about 10 minutes)
  - As soon as the Spaghetti are done, strain them and add them to the pan. Reduce the heat and let them soak up the sauce for about 1-2 minutes, while stirring lightly
  - Optionally garnish with some Grana Padano to taste and enjoy!
