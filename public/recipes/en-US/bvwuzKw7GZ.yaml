steps:
  - Peel the onions and cut them into rings. Put them into a pan with a bit of butter and salt them. Cook them on high heat for about 1 minute, then reduce the heat to a low setting and let them caramelise for about 15-20 minutes.
  - Cut the tomatoes into slices and salt them so they loose water.
  - Wash and dry the rocket.
  - Mix a sauce out of the mustard and mayo and season it with dill, salt and pepper.
  - Fry the "Maultaschen" in a pan with a bit of butter, until they are golden-brown on both sides.
  - Cut open the bread rolls and toast them for a moment on the inside (in the same pan as the "Maultaschen"). Then spread the sauce onto both halves.
  - Assemble the burger with the rocket, onions, Maultaschen and tomatoes and enjoy!
