steps:
  - Slice the mushrooms and cut the onions into fine strips. Slice the tofu very thinly so it can get a bit crispy during frying
  - Heat a pan to high heat with some oil and fry the tofu for about 2 minutes on each side, until it starts to get golden brown
  - Reduce the heat and add the onions and mushrooms. Fry everything for 3 minutes
  - Add the Teriyaki sauce to the pan and cook the mushrooms, onions and tofu for an additional 5 minutes, making sure to stir them from time to time
  - In the mean time, cook the chili noodles according to the instructions on the packaging
  - Mix the cooked noodles into the pan and let them cook for 1-2 additional minutes so they can absorb some of the sauce
  - Serve the noodles in a bowl and optionally garnish with some sesame
