steps:
  - Pre-heat your oven to 180°C. If your oven has a broiler function, activate it. If not, use the function where it heats from the top and bottom and use the top-most rack later.
  - Spread the Crème fraîche on your slices of toast and season it
  - Slice the tomatos as thinly as possible and evenly cover your toast with them
  - Next, slice up your olives and sprinkle them over the tomatos
  - Shred some Gouda cheese (other cheeses are also fine!) and add it to the toast
  - Put the slices onto a baking sheet and bake them for about 5 minutes until the edges of the toast are starting to brown.
  - Enjoy!
