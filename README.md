# [NoNonsense.cooking](https://nononsense.cooking)

NoNonsenseCooking is a modern website for curated recipes trying to cut out all of the unnecessary bloat of typical cooking websites.

## Why?

Simply put: I needed a place to share my favorite recipes with friends & family. I was fed up with existing recipe sites, since they either look horribly outdated and bloated, or use so many trackers that uBlock explodes (or even worse: _both_).

## Contributing

Do you want to add your favorite recipe? It's quite easy!

First, fork this repository and clone it: `gh repo fork riesinger/nononsensecooking`.
This repository uses [bun](github.com/oven-sh/bun) as dependency manager & JS runtime (for local development at least).
Then, install all the dependencies with `bun install` and run the script `bun new-recipe`.
This will ask you a few questions and then creates recipe files in the `recipes` directory.
Edit the file to contain your recipe. You can take the other recipes as an inspiration on how to fill out the YAML file.
If you have an image for your recipe, place a 1440x960 version of it in the `public/img/recipes` directory (any resolution will do, but please make it the given aspect ratio of 3:2 ðŸ™ƒ).

To run the service locally, run `bun dev` and head to `http://localhost:3000`. You should be able to see your recipe in the "All Recipes" section or via the search. Note that you need to restart your dev server when you add a new recipe. Also, the search is using the "recipe index", which you can generate using `bun generate-recipe-index`.

_Please don't copy recipes from the internet or cookbooks (without significant modifications). Also, only use images you took yourself._
